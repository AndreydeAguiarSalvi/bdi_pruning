->***BDI Pruning***<-
This repository contains the source code of my work for the discipline.

## Introduction
The objective of this work is to carry out Channel-wise pruning of convolutional neural networks, using the Jason and PyTorch frameworks.

TODO List:
* Environment
  * [] Training network (Python)
  * [] Making channel-wise pruning (Python)
  * [x] Environment BDI logic (Java)
* Belief Desired Intention
  * [x] Plans (Java)
  * [x] Beliefs (Java)
  * [x] Desires (Java)
* Wrapping
  * [x] Reading channel-pruned list (Java)
  * [] Creating and populating channel-pruned list (Python)
  * [x] Undoing pruning (Java)
  * [] Performing prune (Java to Python)
